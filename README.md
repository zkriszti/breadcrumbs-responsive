# Responsive breadcrumbs menu / Arrows style 

A great way to use when a process (ie. process of a purchase) needs to be introduced to the user. 

I wanted to have an arrow-styled breadcrumb menu that is mobile-first and responsive with a continuous gradient color. Not as trivial as it first seems. 

The concept of the square-shaped pseudo elements as arrows is based on this code: http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/css3-breadcrumb-navigation - but I refactored it to create my responsive version. On mobile screen widths, the elements stack nicely and the arrows are still present.
